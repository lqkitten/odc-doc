Install and run Docker 
===========================================



Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

* Operating system requirements

  * CentOS 7 or 8

    
  
  * The `centos-extras` repository must be enabled. By default, the repository is enabled. If it is disabled, you must enable it. We recommend that you use the `overlay2` storage driver.

    
  

  

* Uninstall the earlier version: If the version of your `Docker` or `Docker-engine` is out dated, run the following command to uninstall it and its dependencies: 

  ```unknow
  $ sudo yum remove docker \
  docker-client \
  docker-client-latest \
  docker-common \
  docker-latest \
  docker-latest-logrotate \
  docker-logrotate \
  docker-engine
  ```

  
  **Note**

  

  If `YUM` reports that none of these program package is installed, skip this step. 

  Keep the content in the `/var/lib/docker/` directory, including images, containers, volume labels, and connection information. The name of the Docker engine installation package is `docker-ce`.
  




Install and run Docker 
-------------------------------------------

### Installation methods 

You can install the Docker engine by using any one of the following methods as needed:

* [Install from repository](#sectiondiv-ucg-44w-6rt): We recommend that you set up the Docker repository and install the Docker engine from it for easy installation and update.

  

* [Install from package](#sectiondiv-1fu-voz-hbn): You can manually download the RPM package of the Docker engine, install it, and then manage the update on your own. This method is quite useful when you need to install Docker on an air-gapped system that cannot access the Internet.

  

* [Install by using the convenience script](#sectiondiv-qr5-wcx-q5v): In a testing or development environment, you can use the automatic convenience script to install Docker.

  




### Install from repository 

Before you install the Docker engine on a new server, you must set up the Docker repository. After that, you can install and update Docker from this repository. 

* Set up the Docker repository

  Run the following command to install the `yum-utils` package and provide the`yum-config-manager` utility, and then set up a **stable** repository. 

  ```unknow
   $ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
   $ sudo yum-config-manager \
      --add-repo \
      https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
  ```

  




<!-- -->

* Install the Docker engine

  1. Run the following command to install the latest Docker engine and containerd: 

     ```unknow
     $ sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
     ```

     

     If you are prompted to accept the GPG key, verify whether the fingerprint matches `060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35`. If yes, accept it. 

     This command installs but does not start Docker. It also creates a `Docker` group. By default, no users are added to the group.
     
  
  2. To install a specific version of the Docker engine, list the versions available in the repository, and then choose a version to install it.

     1. Run the following command to list and sort the versions available in the repository in descending order:

        ```unknow
        $ yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
        ```

        

        The returned list depends on the type of repository enabled and the CentOS version (take `.el7` as an example).
        
     
     2. To install a specific version of the Docker engine, you need to specify the version string of the target package in the following format: `docker-ce` + a hyphen (`-`) + version string between the first colon (`:`) and the first hyphen (-). For example, `docker-ce-18.09.1`. The following example command is provided for your reference only, you must replace \<VERSION_STRING\> with the version string of the target package: 

        ```unknow
        $ sudo yum install docker-ce-<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli-<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
        ```

        

        This command installs but does not start Docker. It also creates a `Docker` group. By default, no users are added to the group.
        
     

     
  
  3. Run the following command to start Docker: 

     ```unknow
     $  sudo systemctl start docker
     ```

     
  
  4. Run the following command to run the `hello-world` image and verify whether the Docker engine is installed. 

     ```unknow
     $ sudo docker run hello-world
     ```

     

     This command downloads the hello-world image and runs it in the container, When the image runs in the container, it displays a message and exits. 
     **Note**

     

     To upgrade the Docker engine, select the new version and install it by following the preceding steps.
     
  

  




### Install from package 

If you cannot use the Docker repository, you can download the `.rpm` package of Docker and install it manually. You need to download a new version of the RPM package every time you want to upgrade the Docker engine. 

1. Go to [Index of linux/centos/](https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/) and select the target CentOS version. Browse the `x86_64/stable/Packages/` directory and download the`.rpm` package of the desired Docker version.

   

2. Run the following command to install the Docker engine. Change the path to that of the target Docker package: 

   ```unknow
   $ sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm
   ```

   

3. Run the following command to start Docker: 

   ```unknow
   $ sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

   

4. Run the following command to run the `hello-world` image and verify whether the Docker engine is installed. 

   ```unknow
   $ sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

   

   This command downloads the hello-world image and runs it in the container, When the image runs in the container, it displays a message and exits.
   




### Install by using the convenience script 

You can use the convenience script provided on [get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com/) to quickly and non-interactively install Docker. 

Check the downloaded script to ensure security before running it. 
**Note**



The following command runs the script with the `DRY_RUN=1` option to demonstrate the installation steps:

```unknow
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ DRY_RUN=1 sh ./get-docker.sh
```



Run the following command to download the script from [get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com/) and run it to install the latest stable version of Docker in Linux:

```unknow
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
Executing docker install script, commit: 7cae5f8b0decc17d6571f9f52eb840fbc13b2737
<...>
```



After Docker is installed, the `Docker` service automatically starts in a Debian-based release. In RPM-based releases such as CentOS, Fedora, RHEL, and SLES, you need to run the `systemctl` or `service` command accordingly to manually start the Docker service. By default, a non-root user cannot run Docker commands. For more information, see the following description. 
**Note**



**Use Docker as a non-root user or install it in the Rootless mode?** 

To install Docker by using the script, you must be the `root` user or a user that has the `sudo` privileges to install and use Docker. Docker can be installed without the `root` privilege or be configured to run in the Rootless mode.

* Install a Docker prerelease

  A convenience script is provided at [test.docker.com](https://test.docker.com/) for you to install a Docker prerelease on Linux. This script is equivalent to that provided at `get.docker.com`. However, this script also provides a package manager to enable the testing channel for the package repository. It includes stable and prerelease versions of Docker. Prereleases include beta versions and release candidates. You can use this script to obtain the new release before the stable version and evaluate it in a test environment. 

  To install the latest version of Docker on Linux from the testing channel, run the following command:

  ```unknow
  $ curl -fsSL https://test.docker.com -o test-docker.sh
  $ sudo sh test-docker.sh
   <...>
  ```

  

* Upgrade Docker

  If you have installed Docker by using the convenience script, we recommend that you use the package manager to upgrade Docker instead of running the convenience script again. This is because adding the repository that has been added to the host may cause problems to Docker. 

  For more information, see [Install the Docker engine in CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/#upgrade-docker-after-using-the-convenience-script).
  




Mount the Docker container 
-----------------------------------------------

**Note**



We recommend that new users use the `--mount` syntax. Experienced users may prefer the `-v` or `--volume` syntax, but the `--mount` syntax is easier to use.

### Start a container by using a bind mount 

Run the following command to mount the `target/` directory to the `/app/` directory of your container. Run the command in the `source` directory. The subcommand `$(pwd)` extends to the current working directory of the Linux or macOS host. For more information about mounting the container on Windows, see [Path conversion on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#path-conversion-on-windows). 

* Mount by using the `--mount` syntax

  ```unknow
  $ docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,target=/app \
  nginx:latest
  ```

  

* Mount by using the `-v` syntax

  ```unknow
  $  docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  -v "$(pwd)"/target:/app \
  nginx:latest
  ```

  

  You can use `docker inspect devtest` to verify whether the container was created and mounted correctly. To look for the `Mounts` section, run the following command:

  ```unknow
  "Mounts": [
      {
          "Type": "bind",
          "Source": "/tmp/source/target",
          "Destination": "/app",
          "Mode": "",
          "RW": true,
          "Propagation": "rprivate"
      }
  ],
  ```

  

  This indicates that the mount is a `bind` mount. It shows the correct source and destination. It indicates that the mount is read-write and the bind propagation is set to `rprivate`. 

  Run the following command to stop the container:

  ```unknow
  $ docker container stop devtest
  $ docker container rm devtest
  ```

  




### Use a read-only bind mount 

For some development applications, the container needs to write into the bind mount to propagate changes back to the Docker host. In other cases, the container only needs read access. 

You can mount the directory as a read-only bind by adding `ro` to the list of options that is empty by default, after the mount point within the container. If multiple options exist, separate them with commas (,). 

* Mount by using the `--mount` syntax

  ```unknow
  $ docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,target=/app,readonly \
  nginx:latest
  ```

  




<!-- -->

* Mount by using the `-v` syntax

  ```unknow
  $  docker run -d \
  -it \
  --name devtest \
  -v "$(pwd)"/target:/app:ro \
  nginx:latest
  ```

  

  You can use `docker inspect devtest` to verify whether the container was created and mounted correctly. To look for the `Mounts` section, run the following command:

  ```unknow
  "Mounts": [
      {
          "Type": "bind",
          "Source": "/tmp/source/target",
          "Destination": "/app",
          "Mode": "ro",
          "RW": false,
          "Propagation": "rprivate"
      }
  ],
  ```

  

  Run the following command to stop the container:

  ```unknow
  $ docker container stop devtest
  $ docker container rm devtest
  ```

  




The following table describes the parameters.


|     Parameter      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--name `          | Specifies the name of the container.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `-v` or `--volume` | Consists of three fields that are separated with colons ( `:`). The fields must be ordered correctly. The meaning of each field is not immediately obvious.  * In the case of a bind mount, the first field is the path or directory of the file on the **host** .   * The second field is the path where the file or directory is mounted in the container.   * The third field is optional and contains a list of options separated with commas (,), such as a list of `ro`, `z`, `Z`.    |
| `--mount`          | Consists of multiple key-value pairs that are separated with commas (,). Each key-value pair consists of a`<key>=<value>` tuple. The `--mount` syntax is more verbose than the `-v` or `--volume` syntax, but the order of the keys is not significant and the value of the flag is easier to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `type`             | The type can be `bind, volume`, or `tmpfs`. As this topic discusses the bind mount, the type is always `bind`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `source`           | For a bind mount, it is the path of the file or directory on the Docker host. You can specify it as `source` or `src`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `destination`      | Indicates the path where the file or directory is mounted in the container. You can specify it as `destination`, `dst`, or `target`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| readonly           | If present, the parameter causes the bind mount to be mounted into the container as read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
